# Sorting-Algorithms
Sorting algorithms in a variety of languages.
Sorting is used in programming with the purpose of sorting arrays in order to accomplish diffferent tasks. Of course there are built-in sorts in most programmin languages but it is important to know how sorting algorithms work, not because you will need to write your own, but because they equip you with a better understading of how to solve any fututre programming problems that you may have to surmount.

# Bubble-Sort
Bubble Sort is a very slow sorting algorithm as it has a time complexity of O(n^2).

# Selection-Sort
Selection Sort is also a very slow sorting algorithm due to its high time complexity fo O(n^2).

# Insertion-Sort
Insertion Sort is another sorting algorithm that isn't exactly known for its speed, having a time complexity of O(n^2)

# Merge-Sort
Merge Sort is a very fast sorting algorithm as it uses a techique called divide and conquer in order to finish its tasks faster. It has a time complexity of O(nlogn)

# Quick-Sort
Quick Sort despite having the same time complexity as Merge Sort, O(nlogn), it is preferred over Merge Sort as it is more efficient in real time.
